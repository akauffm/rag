To get this working on the Mac:

1. clone the repo and cd into it
2. create a virtual environment 'python -m venv venv' then activate it 'source venv/bin/activate'
3. run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
4. run 'python create_vector_db.py' â€” once it's done, you should have a folder called "storage" that includes the vector database and associated files
5. make sure ollama is installed and running
6. run 'python rag.py' and ask a question about something that's in the wikitext2.txt file in the data directory

You can change models by changing the OLLAMA_MODEL_NAME constant

To get this working (albeit incredibly slowly) on the Raspberry Pi:

1: perform steps 1-3 as above
2: copy the "storage" folder from the Mac into the Raspberry Pi folder
3: perform steps 5-6 from above
